# Running On Custom Inputs

This folder allows you to run the algorithm/structures on any custom input you pass in.

Simply create a file of the similar structure as in the src/ folder or import the respective package to call the
algorithm/structure in the `main` method of the file you create. Then, run the file via IntelliJ as per normal.

Some samples are shown.
