# data-structures-and-algorithms
This repository contains implementation of some of the fundamental data structures and algorithms in Computer Science. It is primarily used as a teaching resource and is currently being developed by ex-2040s students.

## Full List of Implementation (in alphabetical order):
## Structures
- Adelson-Velskii and Landis (AVL) Binary Search Tree
- Disjoint Set
    * Quick Find
    * Weighted Union with path compression
- [Heap]()
    * Max heap implementation
- Linked List
- LRU Cache
- Minimum Spanning Tree
- Queue
- Segment Tree
    * Improved version does not require O(2^n) space here
- Stack
- Trie


## Algorithms
- [Counting Sort](src/algorithms/sorting/countingSort/)
- Cyclic Sort
- [Matrix Operations](others/matrix_operations/)
- Merge Sort
    * Recursive
    * Bottom-up iterative
- Radix Sort
- Quick Sort
    * 3-way Partitioning

5. Heap
6. Disjoint Set / Union Find
7. Hashing
    * Bloom filter
8. Basic graphs
    * Depth-first search
    * Breadth-first search
9. Graphs
