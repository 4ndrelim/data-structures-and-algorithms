# Prim's Algorithm

## Background

Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph by starting from an
arbitrary node (vertex) and adding the edge with the minimum weight that connects the current tree to a new node, adding
the node to the current tree, until all nodes are included in the tree.
