/** Here, we are implementing BubbleSort where we sort the array in increasing (or more precisely, non-decreasing)
 * order.
 *
 * Brief Description and Implementation Invariant:
 * BubbleSort relies on the outer loop variant that after the ith iteration, the biggest i items are correctly sorted
 * at the final i positions of the array. The job of the ith iteration of the outer loop is to bubble the (i + 1)th
 * largest element (because of 0-based indexing) to the ith position of the array from the right (i.e. its correct
 * position). This is done through repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong
 * order.
 *
 * At the end of the (n-1)th iteration of the outer loop, where n is the length of the array, the (n-1) elements are
 * correctly sorted at the final (n-1) positions of the array, leaving the last 1 element placed correctly in the
 * first position of the array. Therefore, (n-1) iterations of the outer loop is sufficient.
 *
 * At the ith iteration of the outer loop, we only require (n-1-i) adjacent comparisons to get the (i + 1)th largest
 * element to its correct position.
 *
 * Complexity Analysis:
 * Time:
 * - Worst case (reverse sorted array): O(n^2)
 * - Average case: O(n^2)
 * - Best case (sorted array): O(n)
 * In the worst case, during each iteration of the outer loop, the number of adjacent comparisons is upper-bounded
 * by n. Since BubbleSort requires (n-1) iterations of the outer loop to sort the entire array, the total number
 * of comparisons performed can be upper-bounded by (n-1) * n â‰ˆ n^2.
 *
 * This implementation of BubbleSort terminates the outer loop once there are no swaps within one iteration of the
 * outer loop. This improves the best case time complexity to O(n) for an already sorted array.
 *
 * Space:
 * - O(1) since sorting is done in-place
